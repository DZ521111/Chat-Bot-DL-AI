The problem with them is that they're more expensive to get out than a standard breaker suite (e.g. Corroder Garrote Gordian or Corroder Femme Cyber-Cypher or something), are less efficient than a standard breaker suite, and are not cards you can run without also having a standard breaker suite.

I don't mind Suicide Silence, the music itself is good (and Dan Kenny is metal as fuck) but it's the vocals I cant stand. Just the style of it, switching from intense highs to intense lows. I like this because if Randy though
You could say the same for getting your mace and pointing in the right direction. Depends on which you're more practiced in.

I am not, it's direct to the computer.  I've tried several USB cables as well.  I'm pretty sure it's the unit itself.  I'll probably return it.
It's probably my favorite beer! It's good for special occasions. But I don't have it too often.
