I watched all the LOTR movies awhile ago and was blown away that the tree people were also called Ents, but it wasn't til you spelled it out for me that I put 2 and 2 together. Cheers, pal.
Yup, we put it on Eggos.  Warm, melty, and the Eggos don't have any flavor of their own to get in the way.
Straczynski's book is what I grabbed when I first started screenwriting. I learned most of what I use, now incorporating my own style, from that book. Mine was a different print run with a pale yellow cover.

I think I read somewhere that if you have an awful win/lose ratio (only winning 99/100 games) then you don't go straight to challenger. You have to play multiple games AFTER PLACEMENT to reach challenger. It must be really tough being that bad.
It's not about stats though, it's a card that will never be off curve and rarely a bad play. It will never be unplayable like Tree of Life on turn 1 and it will never be useless like a robocub on turn 10.
